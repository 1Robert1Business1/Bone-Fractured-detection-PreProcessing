Histogram equalization and normalization are both techniques used in image processing, but they serve different purposes and operate differently:

Histogram Equalization:

Histogram equalization is a technique used to enhance the contrast of an image by adjusting the distribution of intensity values in its histogram.
It aims to spread out the intensity values across the entire range of possible values, resulting in a more balanced distribution and improved contrast.
Histogram equalization is particularly effective for images with low contrast or limited dynamic range.

Normalization:

Normalization, in the context of image processing, typically refers to scaling the intensity values of an image to a predefined range, such as [0, 1] or [-1, 1].
Normalization is often performed to standardize the intensity values of images across different datasets or to ensure that they fall within a specific numerical range suitable for processing or model training.
Unlike histogram equalization, normalization does not alter the distribution of intensity values or enhance contrast. It simply scales the values to a desired range.
In summary, histogram equalization and normalization are distinct techniques with different objectives. Histogram equalization enhances contrast by redistributing intensity values, while normalization scales intensity values to a predefined range without altering their distribution.
